### New product market research project

The purpose of this exploratory study is to investigate the factors relevant to the purchase and the purchase price of the USB toaster. Additionally, this project was designed to compare the preliminary Sample 1 and Sample 2 collected from the Design of Experiments team (DOE), and to justify the collection of Sample 2. Sample 2 was a well-designed sample: the DOE sampled randomly from the five major metropolitan areas targeted for the initial product roll-out. We explored the factors relevant to purchase and purchase price by applying a multiple regression analysis on Sample 2 data. To analyze the data properly, we first identified and agreed upon a process to address missing and incomplete observations. From the logistic regression model on purchase, we found that the relevant factors were age, profession, marital status, education, whether they have a mortgage or personal loans, non-mortgage loan balance, and types of contact device. From the regression model on price, we found similar results of significant factors: profession, education, marital status, whether they have a mortgage or personal loan, and type of contact device, but we also found credit default and the purchase of the product had a significant impact as well. From this information, there is a better understanding of potential target audience for the USB toaster to maximize sales and profit.
